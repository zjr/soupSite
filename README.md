========

Soupy iteration of http://zjr.io.  Was originally going to have a hamburgerâ€¦ non-icon kind.

FYI, this is an angular application... dev with yeoman, bower, grunt, &c..

Setup would require node & npm to be installed.  Then the following will install dependencies & startup a server at `0.0.0.0:9000`

```bash
npm install && bower install && grunt serve
```
